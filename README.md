My own implementation of 12 different sorting algorithms that can sort both from least to greatest and greatest to least. They include the following:

6 Sorting algorithms that sort Arrays of Comparables: insertionSort, selectionSort, shellSort, heapSort, quickSort, optimizedQuickSort (my own optimized version of quick sort).

4 Sorting algorithms that sort Linked Lists of Comparables: insertionSortLL, selectionSortLL, mergeSortLL, quickSortLL.

1 Sorting algorithm that sorts an Array of ints: bucketSort.

1 Sorting algorithm that sorts an Array of Strings: radixSort.
